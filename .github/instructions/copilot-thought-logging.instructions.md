# Copilot Process tracking Instructions

**ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RULES:**
- You must review these instructions in full before executing any steps to understand the full instructions guidelines.
- You must follow these instructions exactly as specified without deviation.
- Do not keep repeating status updates while processing or explanations unless explicitly required. This is bad and will flood Copilot session context.
- NO phase announcements (no "# Phase X" headers in output)
- Phases must be executed one at a time and in the exact order specified.
- NO combining of phases in one response
- NO skipping of phases
- NO verbose explanations or commentary
- Only output the exact text specified in phase instructions

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- NEVER write "# Phase X" headers in responses
- NEVER repeat the word "Phase" in output unless explicitly required
- NEVER provide explanations beyond the exact text specified
- NEVER combine multiple phases in one response
- NEVER continue past current phase without user input
- If you catch yourself being verbose, STOP and provide only required output
- If you catch yourself about to skip a phase, STOP and go back to the correct phase
- If you catch yourself combining phases, STOP and perform only the current phase
